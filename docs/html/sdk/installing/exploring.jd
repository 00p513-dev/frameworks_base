<p>That's it! Your Android SDK is ready for action.</p>

<p>Before you get started though, we suggest that you open the SDK directory and get familiar with
the files inside. The table below describes the full SDK directory contents, with packages
installed. </p>

<p>If you're eager to start developing, we suggest you start with <a

<a href="#Next">next steps</a> below.</p>

location of the SDK's <code>tools/</code> and
<code>platform-tools</code> to your <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</p>


<h2 id="Next">Next Steps</h2>


<p>Now that you've completed the SDK installation, you are ready to
develop Android apps. Here are a few ways you can get started: </p>

<p><strong>Start coding</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the training class for <a
href="{@docRoot}training/basics/firstapp/index.html">Building Your First App</a>.
    <p>This class is an essential first step for new Android developers.</p>
    <p>It gives you step by step instructions for building a simple app. Youâ€™ll learn how to
create an Android project and run a debuggable version of the app. You'll also learn some
fundamentals of Android app design, including how to build a simple user interface and handle user
input.</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Read up on the API framework</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Start reading about fundamental framework topics in the collection of <a
href="{@docRoot}guide/index.html">Guides</a>.</li>
  <li>Browse the Android API specifications in the <a
  href="{@docRoot}reference/packages.html">Reference</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Explore the development tools</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Learn about the process for developing an app from end to end with the <a
  href="{@docRoot}tools/index.html">Workflow</a> documentation.</li>
  <li>Learn about debugging your apps with the <a
href="{@docRoot}tools/debugging/index.html">Debugging</a> guides.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Explore some code</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Browse the sample apps downloaded from the Android SDK Manager. You'll find them in
<code><em>&lt;sdk&gt;</em>/samples/<em>&lt;platform-version&gt;/</em></code>. </li>
</ul>
