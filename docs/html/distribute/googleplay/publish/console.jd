<p>When your registration is verified, you can sign in to your Google Play Android Developer Console, which will be the home for your app publishing operations and tools on Google Play. </p>

<h3>Your Developer Profile</h3>

<p>Your developer profile identifies you to Google Play and to your customers. During registration you can provide information for your profile, but you can go back at any time to edit the information and change your settings. </p>

<p>Your developer profile contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your developer name &mdash; the name you want to show users on your product details page and elsewhere on Google Play. 
<li>Your developer contact information &mdash; how Google can contact you if needed (this information isn't exposed to users.
<li>Merchant information, in-app billing information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple user accounts</h3>

<p>If you are working with a team, you can set up multiple user accounts to access different parts of your Developer Console. The first account registered is the <em>account owner</em>, with full access to all parts of the Console. The owner can add <em>user accounts</em> and manage what parts of the Console they have access to. For example, an owner can grant users access to publishing and app configuration, but not access to financial reports. </p>

<h3>Linking your Merchant Account</h3>

<p>If you want to sell apps or in-app products, you can link your Google Checkout Merchant account to your developer profile. Google Play uses the linked Checkout account for financial and tax identification and monthly payouts of sales. </p>

<h3>Your product and listing details</h3>

<p>The Developer Console lets you set up a colorful storefront page for your app called the <em>product details page</em>. Your product details page is the home for your app in Google Play &mdash; it's the page users see on their mobile phones or on the web when they want to learn about your app and download it. </p>

<p>You can upload custom brand assets, screen shots, and videos to highlight what's great about your app, and you can provide a localized description, add notes about the latest version, and more. You can update your store listing at any time, even if you donâ€™t have a new version of your application.</p>


<h3>Uploading and publishing</h3>

<p>From the Developer Console you can quickly upload a release-ready APK and publish it when you're ready. The app is a <em>draft</em> until you publish it, at which time Google Play makes your product details page and app available to users. You can unpublish the app at any time.

<h3>Distribution Controls</h3>

<p>In the Developer Console you can manage what countries and territories the app is distributed to and, for some countries, you can choose what carriers you want to target.</p>

<p>You can also see the list of devices that your app is currently available to, based on any distribution rules declared in its manifest file.</p>

<h3>Selling and pricing your Products</h3>

<p>On Google Play, your app can be free to download or priced (charged before download). If you publish your app as free, it must remain free; if you publish it as priced, you can change it to free, Free apps can be downloaded by any user in Google Play. In addition, you can sell in-app products and subscriptions in your app. You can set prices separately for priced apps, in-app products, and subscriptions.</p>

<p>If you are selling a priced app or in-app products or subscriptions, the Developer Console lets you set prices in a large number of different currencies. When users around the world visit your product details page, they see the price of your app in their own currency. For most countries, the price you set is the final price charged to users, inclusive of taxes. </p>

<p>To help you manage your prices, the Developer Console provides an autofill capability that uses recent exchange rates to populate the prices in all supported currencies. You can change prices for apps and in-app products at any time, just by saving changes in the Develoer Console.</p>

<h3>In-app Billing</h3>

<div class="sidebox">
<h2>In-app Billing</h2>
<p>For details on how to implement In-app Billing in your apps, see the <a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/billing/index.html">In-app Billing</a> developer documentation.</p></div></div>

<p><a href="{@docRoot}guide/google/billing/index.html">In-app Billing</a> is a Google Play service that lets you monetize your apps in more ways by selling in-app products and subscriptions. In-app products are one-time purchases, while  subscriptions are recurring charges on an monthly or annual basis.</p>

<p>From the developer console you can create product lists for in-app products and subscriptions, set prices, and publish.</p>

<h3>User reviews and error reports</h3>

<p>Google Play makes it easy for users to submit reviews of your app for the benefit of other users. The reviews are also useful to you, since they can highlight strengths and weakness of your app and bring important functionality issues to your attention. Through the Developer Console, you can send private replies to specific user reviews to ask for more information or let the user know a problem is addressed. 

<p>The Developer console also lets you see error reports submitted automatically from Android devices, for debugging and improving your app.</p>

<h3>App statistics</h3>

<p>The Developer Console gives you detailed statistics on the install performance of your app. </p>
