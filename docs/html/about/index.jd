<p>Android is reshaping the way people communicate. It’s in your phone or tablet, on your wrist, in
your car, on your TV, in your camera, at your home, and at the store. It’s practically an
unlimited landscape for app developers.</p>

<p>Android gives you an open platform for developing any app you can imagine, and an open
marketplace for distributing your products to a large and growing user base. Whether you are just
starting out or you are already on your way, Android has the platform, tools, and devices to make it
happen for you.</p>

<h3>Global partnerships and large installed base</h3>

<p>Building on the contributions of the open-source Linux community and more than 300 hardware,
software, and carrier partners, Android has rapidly become the fastest-growing mobile OS. As of
February, 2012,
there are more than 300 million activated Android devices.</p>

<blockquote>Every day more than 700,000 new
devices are activated in more than 137 countries and regions</blockquote>

<p>Android’s openness has made it a favorite for consumers and developers alike, driving strong
growth
in app consumption. In the third quarter 2011 alone, people downloaded more than 2.4 billion apps to
their Android devices.</p>

<h3>Rapid innovation</h3>

<p>Android is continuously pushing the boundaries of hardware and software forward, to bring new
capabilities to users and developers. For developers, the rapid evolution of Android technology lets
you stay in front with powerful, differentiated applications.</p>

<p>Android gives you access to the latest technologies and innovations across a multitude of device
form-factors, chipset architectures, and price points. From multicore processing and
high-performance graphics to state-of-the-art sensors, vibrant touchscreens, and emerging mobile
technologies such as Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi Direct, and face tracking.



<h3>Powerful development environment</h3>

<blockquote>Android gives
you an open platform for creating any app experience that you can imagine</blockquote>

<p>Android gives you everything you need to build best-in-class app experiences. It provides a
single
application model that runs everywhere, so you can deploy your apps to a wide range of devices, from
phones to tablets and beyond. Across all devices, Android gives you consistent, powerful APIs to
manage UI and take advantage of the hardware capabilities available on each device.</p>
